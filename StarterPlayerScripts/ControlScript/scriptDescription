As soon as the player's character is added, it connects to the main function.

the function then sets coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading to true, opens the Play Screen, and begins loading the templates.

it has 3 functions binded to RunService's Heartbeat:

1. autoLoadTemplates
  checks if the player is 20 templates away from the end, and if it's not already loading to prevent stacking another thread.
  if both conditions are satisfied, then coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading will be set to true to prevent another thread from being created.
  it then calls coreFunctions.loadTemplates("Classic")
  
2. binsTemplatesBehind
  if coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading isn't true,
  then it will loop through coreFunctions.templatesTable (which is a table that carries the templates in workspace.)
  it will check if the template in the current array is within or through the limit, and if it is not already in the bin.
  if both conditions are positive, it will remove the current template from coreFunctions.templatesTable, and add it to coreFunctions.templatebin.
  
3. Reset when Play Button is clicked
  this heartbeat constantly checks if the "Play Again!" button is clicked
