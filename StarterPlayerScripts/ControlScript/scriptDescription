As soon as the player's character is added, it connects to the main function.

the function then sets coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading to true, opens the Play Screen, and begins loading the templates.

it has 3 functions binded to RunService's Heartbeat:

1. autoLoadTemplates
  checks if the player is 20 templates away from the end, and if it's not already loading, and if templatesReadyToSetUp is set to true
  to prevent stacking another thread.
  if both conditions are satisfied, then coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading will be set to true to prevent another thread from being created.
  it then calls coreFunctions.loadTemplates("Classic")
  
2. binsTemplatesBehind
  if coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading isn't true,
  then it will loop through coreFunctions.templatesTable (which is a table that carries the templates in workspace.)
  it will check if the template in the current array is within or through the limit, and if it is not already in the bin.
  if both conditions are positive, it will remove the current template from coreFunctions.templatesTable, and add it to coreFunctions.templatebin.
  
3. Reset when Play Button is clicked
  this heartbeat constantly checks if the "Play Again!" button is clicked using trackerFolder.Booleans.playAgainButtonIsClicked.Value.
  If the condition is positive, it will then set trackerFolder.Booleans.playAgainButtonIsClicked.Value to false to prevent more threads from being created,
  and templatesReadyToSetUp to false to prevent autoLoadTemplates from creating another thread for loading the templates.
  
  the script then enters a reset phase which include the following functions by order:
      
			coreFunctions.resetPlayAgainButtonIsClickedBoolean()
      
			coreFunctions.generalRefresh() -- A function that calls a some other functions with the goal of refreshing data.
                                        coreFunctions.resetPlayerPosition() -- Puts the player's character back to it's position
                                        coreFunctions.resetPlayerLevel() -- Resets the PlayerLevel used to track, well... the player's level
                                        coreFunctions.resetLevelCounter() -- Resets the LevelCounter used to assign levels to new templates during dupes
                                        coreFunctions.resetLatestTemplateVector() -- Resets the recorded data of the latest template's position in Vector3
                                        coreFunctions.clearAllTemplates() -- This functions puts templates to the bin, then delete them from existance.
      
			coreFunctions.templatesReadyToSetUp = true
      
			coreFunctions.resetPlayerIsDeadBoolean() -- This boolean is reset so that the player may finally move.
      
  the script then waits until playerIsDead.Value == false
  
  once playerIsDead.Value is finally set to false and the player may move around, we call coreFunctions.loadTemplates("Classic") to finally get the player
  to play again.
      
  the script then loads some templates with the function: coreFunctions.loadTemplates("Classic")
