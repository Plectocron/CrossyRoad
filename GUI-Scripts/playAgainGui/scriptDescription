As soon as the player has is detected to be jumping into a drownZone, the script: characterMover, the player was pronounced dead, & calls to open this GUI.

If the player clicks the Play Again Button, a debounce has been set to avoid spam.

The script then fades the screen black with the function: coreFunctions.fadeIn(game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui.BlackScreen).

Once the screen is pitch black, it closes this GUI.

It then sets the Global Boolean: playAgainButtonIsClickedBoolean, to true. Which triggers a reset phase, and loads the templates back with the function:
coreFunctions.loadTemplates("Classic")

Once the Global Boolean value, playAgainButtonIsClickedBoolean, is set to true, the black screen fades out with the function:
coreFunctions.fadeOut(game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui.BlackScreen)
