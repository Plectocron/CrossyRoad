As soon as the player's character is added to the game, the script will check if the player has ever clicked the button before.

If not, it will enable the GUI

Once the play button is clicked, the script will make the screen fade black with the function: coreFunctions.fadeIn(blackScreenGui)

The screen slowly fades. Once it has reached pitch black, the FirstLoadGui is Disabled.

It then waits 0.5 seconds, then gradually makes the blackScreenGui transparent with the function: coreFunctions.fadeOut(blackScreenGui)
