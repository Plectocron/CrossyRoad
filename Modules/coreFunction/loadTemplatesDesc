The function first checks for the version from the first parameter.


                                                                        "Classic"

    It then sets coreFunctions.isCurrentlyLoading to true

    It collects a bunch of variable, such as: 
        randomStartPlace -- Finds a random start place within classicSceneryFolder.startPlace
        studsPerTemplate -- Gets the amount of studs to move to one point. (normally 12 studs)
        obstacleTemplates -- Ranges from roads, grassfields traintracks, water.
        (etc. etc.)
        
    The functions then calls another function: loadStart()
        the function sets coreFunctions.startLoaded to true so that when loadTemplates() is called, it's sure whether or not it should load the startplace
        with the variable startPlace, the randomly picked start place gets cloned and parented to the workspace.
